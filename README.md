**<b> SVXLink and DVSwitch </b>**
While there are repositories from which to download and compile SVXLink they do require quite a bit of understanding.
This script takes only a little SSH knowledge to pull the various downloads together to create the basis of a ready-to-configure system.

It has to be done under conditions of research in the original source manuals found on Svxlink.org and the man files.
However this script pulls the SVXLink software from Adi DL1HRC's fork, that has the UsrpLogic necessary to drive the DVSwitch components.

It is NOT plug and play when all is said and done however. It does still require a little manipulation of the configuration files, 
but the compilation of the major part of the software is done for you.
